##Saving my dotfiles in case of computer disaster

I'm trying to do this using other people's work with minimal
customization. To do so, I'm making use of
- iTerm2 & homebrew (not included here, obviously)
- prezto (a new version of oh-my-zsh)
- certain vim plugins (via vundle; powerline required a new font...)

What remains is a few things I still needed to customize.
